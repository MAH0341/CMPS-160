// 1. Make all countries in the following array follow the same formatting:
//    The first letter should be upper case, the rest lower case. Store the properly capitalized
//    country names in a new array called countries2. Print countries2 to the console.

var countries = ["AustraliA", "greece", "PERU", "ChInA"];


// 2. Get every second and third letter from each country in countries2 and concatenate them.
//    Print the results to the console.

// 3. In the sentence below replace 'a dart' with 'an arrow' and log the result to the console.

var sentence = "Time flies like a dart; fruit flies like a banana.";

// 4. Find the index of the last occurrence of flies in the sentence below.

var sentence2 = "The fisherman flies to his favorite spot, where he flies his rod and reel, hoping to catch some flies for dinner.";

// 5. Prompt the user for a string, reverse it, and show the result to the user using an alert.

var userInput = prompt("Please enter a string:");

// 6. Round the value using the round function.

// 7. Round the value up.

var roundedUpValue = Math.ceil(value);

// 9. Simulate a coin flip by generating a random number. Assume the coin is
//    fair and print the result, heads or tails, to the console.

// 11. Write code that does the following: (1) Use a prompt to obtain the
//    birth year of the user. (2) Use a prompt to obtain the birth month of
//    the user. (3) Use a prompt to obtain the birth day of the user.
//    (4) Calculate how old the user is in days. (5) Show the result to
//    the user via the console.
